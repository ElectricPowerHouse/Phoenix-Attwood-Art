For sam: 

Are you going to code the whole thing yourself? Things that need to be done: 
Backend, High res image loading (before the actual page loads), thumbnail choose etc.

Things I can do (probably): 

Transitions, fades, animations etc, small visual tweaks

For Phoenix:

- Finalize exactly which paintings are going on the site
- Finalize paintings that are shown on front page ( May have to change front page background design if they are different from current ones)
- Decide whether you would like to put a watermark on your paintings if you don't want people downloading the high-res images.
- Put in your bio text
- Put in your contact details
